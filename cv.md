3. My goal's to become Front-end:sagittarius: dev at the end of it's all.

Glad to meet and be friends with many good people:feet:, with bad, don't wanna too much:biohazard:.

In a few words, I have a warm:sunrise:, non-conflict:beers:, friendly:raised_hands: character:copyright:.

Cause haven't too much coding experience:baby:, promise that will learn so fast than may:runner:, half joking, won't only learning but and use something that learned in projects and tasks:hammer_and_wrench:, if it's necessary, so I can take to more new practice which is very important in my case:dart:.

I'm not thinking that if would have a mentor:man_teacher: upster me that He must do some actions so the atmosphere:part_alternation_mark: will be comfortable only for students. :man_student:They should do something else to uprise:punch::fist_left: mentor also, cause I know that we all humans and we need sometimes rest:sleeping_bed: or hope of each others:boy:!

It can sound egoistic and arrogantly:man_astronaut: but I have a mind which accepts new information fast, to improve memory and not forget what's learn I use mind program so every time if my memory cant helps me I go-to program to revise:ok_man:.
